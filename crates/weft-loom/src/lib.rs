//! `weft-loom` — the vectorized CPU engine and Weft's workhorse.
//!
//! **This is what beats Sail on ClickBench.** Phase 0 embeds DataFusion behind the warp
//! IR to reach correctness + a credible benchmark entry fast. Phase 1 carves out native
//! operators for the handful of queries that dominate the total runtime:
//!
//! - high-cardinality `GROUP BY` (Q31–Q35): adaptive, radix-partitioned, open-addressing
//!   hash table with an inline hash salt; spill partitions independently;
//! - sort / top-N (Q23–Q26 and every `… ORDER BY c DESC LIMIT 10`): late-materialized
//!   top-N heap that decodes only the surviving rows;
//! - string `LIKE`/regex (Q20–Q23, Q28): SIMD substring + vectorized regex;
//! - `COUNT(DISTINCT)` (Q4/Q5 + per-group): HyperLogLog sketches.
//!
//! The strategy: tie Sail on the ~33 cheap queries (DataFusion parity), beat it 1.5–2× on
//! the ~10 expensive ones. Winning those *is* winning the total.
