//! Distributed shuffle: the control envelope carried in Flight tickets, hash partitioning of
//! stage output into per-downstream buckets, and (gated) serialized physical-plan fragments.
//!
//! The MVP shape is `partial-agg per worker → hash shuffle by key → re-aggregate per worker`,
//! which is the smallest real shuffle that proves the mechanism while only needing
//! SQL-expressible re-combinable aggregates (COUNT→SUM, SUM→SUM, MIN→MIN, MAX→MAX).
