//! The control envelopes carried in Flight `do_get` tickets for distributed execution.
//!
//! These are prost messages (not raw SQL) so a ticket can describe a whole stage: which
//! plan to run, how its output is partitioned, and where the upstream partitions live. The
//! serialized DataFusion physical-plan fragment (when present) rides as opaque bytes in
//! [`StageTicket::plan_fragment`]; only that field depends on `datafusion-proto`, so a proto
//! version skew there never touches this envelope.
