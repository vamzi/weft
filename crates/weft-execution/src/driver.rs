//! The distributed driver: orchestrate a stage DAG across a static set of workers.
//!
//! A query is expressed as a topologically-ordered list of [`StageDef`]s. Each *producer* stage
//! (one that another stage consumes) runs on every worker, hash-partitions its output into one
//! bucket per worker, and caches the buckets; the single *output* stage runs on every worker as a
//! consumer, pulling its bucket of each upstream from every worker and returning the result.
//!
//! The MVP shape — two stages, `partial-agg → hash shuffle → final-agg` — is the
//! [`DistributedPlan`] convenience built on top of this (see [`DistributedPlan::into_stages`]).
//! Multiple upstreams on the output stage express a **shuffle join**: both sides hash-partition on
//! the join key so matching keys co-locate on one worker, which then joins them locally.
//!
//! v1 limits: producer stages must be leaves (an intermediate stage that both consumes *and*
//! produces — needed for chains of joins like TPC-H Q5 — is a follow-up); static worker list; no
//! shuffle spill.
