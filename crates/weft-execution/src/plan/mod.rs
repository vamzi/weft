//! Automatic distributed planning: derive a [`StageDef`](crate::driver::StageDef) DAG from a SQL
//! query, so callers no longer hand-author partial/final stage SQL.
//!
//! Primary path: shape-based partial/final aggregation + broadcast/shuffle joins
//! ([`stage_planner`]). Fallback: single-stage [`ExchangeMode::Forward`](crate::driver::ExchangeMode)
//! via [`physical_splitter`] so any locally-plannable SQL still gets a distributed job graph.
