//! `weft-execution` — local and distributed execution of physical plans.
//!
//! Local mode runs the physical plan across a thread pool (morsel-driven). Distributed
//! mode splits the plan into stages at shuffle boundaries: a driver/worker control plane and
//! an Arrow Flight data plane for shuffle + result return. The MVP shape is two-stage
//! `partial-agg → hash shuffle → final-agg` ([`driver::run_distributed`]). Out-of-core,
//! partitioned shuffle with spill is a deliberate divergence lane — Sail's cluster mode is new
//! (Feb 2026) and its ClickBench is single-process-per-query.
