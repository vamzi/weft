# Weft

**A drop-in Apache Spark replacement.** Weft speaks the [Spark Connect](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-connect-overview.html)
protocol, so unmodified PySpark and Spark SQL clients connect with a one-line URL change — no JVM.

> **Weft starts where Sail ends.** A lean vectorized CPU core (**Loom**) beats Sail on the
> queries that dominate ClickBench, and an opt-in HVM2/Bend backend (**Weft-HVM**) opens a
> second front for the embarrassingly-parallel, irregular workloads no columnar engine serves well.

## Status

Pre-alpha scaffold. The workspace compiles but does not yet execute queries. See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the full plan and
[`docs/ISSUES.md`](docs/ISSUES.md) for the first three issues.

                              weft-datasource (Parquet/Delta/Iceberg) ─ weft-catalog (Unity/Glue/Hive)
```

Everything between operators is Apache Arrow. `weft-hvm` is the *only* place data leaves Arrow,
and only for coarse, routed fragments — never the columnar hot loop.

## Why not "just compile everything to Bend"?

Because HVM2 (Bend's runtime) has no data plane: 24-bit numerics (a `SUM`/`COUNT` overflows at
16.7M), no hash-table primitive, no columnar/SIMD type, a 4 GB heap, no I/O/FFI, and a CUDA-only,
RTX-4090-only GPU path the maintainers themselves call "less stable." On ClickBench — pure
columnar/SIMD work — HVM2 loses every query. So Loom (vectorized native) carries the benchmark;
HVM2 is a gated research bet for a *different* workload class. See `docs/architecture.md` §3, §6.

## North star

Beat [Sail's published ClickBench result](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickBench/tree/main/sail)
on `c6a.4xlarge`, CPU-only: total hot runtime ≤ ~56.3 s across all 43 queries, published as an
independent, reproducible ClickBench entry.

## Build

```sh
cargo build --workspace   # stub builds on Rust 1.72+
cargo test  --workspace
```

The runtime crates that will pull in DataFusion/Arrow/tonic require **Rust ≥ 1.80** and **protoc**;
those deps are stubbed out today (see each crate's `Cargo.toml` TODOs).

## Run (target UX, not yet implemented)

```sh
weft spark server --port 50051
```
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.remote("sc://localhost:50051").getOrCreate()
spark.sql("SELECT count(*) FROM parquet.`hits.parquet`").show()
```
